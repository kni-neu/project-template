# Project Template CS6220

## Data

This folder is where you can put your data. I would not recommend committing any data, as this can make your development cycles and code sharing slow.

## Source Code

## Documentation - Report Template

In the folder [./docs](./docs), you will find three `*.tex` files:

1. `project.tex`, the template for a generic project template
2. `kdd-draft.tex`, the template for a conference draft
3. `kdd-conf.tex`, the template  for a conference submission

You are free to choose any of the formats.
